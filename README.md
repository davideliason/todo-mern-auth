## Intro

This is an application exploring the quintessential CRUD functionality of a MERN stack, using MongoDB, express, node.js, and react.

## Lessons Learned

I learned a lot about [passport](https://davideliason.github.io/node/using-passport-with-node/) module, which you can read about in that blog post. The spectrum of modules available to node developers is pretty amazing!

I was uncertain as to approaching the build for this app - I wanted the result of having user login with authentication, and then the functionality of having CRUD for todos along with image uploads.
